# Test Results - Timestamped files in results subfolder (keep only recent ones)
results/TEST_RESULTS_20*.md

# Keep these important files tracked in main tests directory:
!TEST_RESULTS_LATEST.md
!TEST_RESULTS_SUMMARY.md

# Allow the results directory to be tracked (but not its timestamped contents)
!results/
results/*
!results/.gitkeep

# Allow keeping a few recent timestamped files for comparison
# Uncomment the line below to track the last few timestamped results:
# !results/TEST_RESULTS_2025-*.md
